"""GENERATED for polymul/negacyclic@1.0.0. Do not edit — `--update` rewrites it.

    ./solution <point directory>

Reads the directory a bundle prepared, answers every case in it, and writes
what each one cost.

    manifest.json     the point, and how many cases      read
    cases/000000/     one file per argument              read
    out/000000/       one file per result                written
    out/results.json  what each case cost                written

Only the call to run() is timed. Reading and writing are outside the window.
